There are 7 MATLAB files(.m files) that have to run in MATLAB for simulation which you can access from APPENDICES in the REPORT or the “code_files” folder provided:
(1) Simulation of Aircraft’s Longitudanal Motion State Space equations without any control signal (OPEN LOOP)
(2) Simulation of Aircraft’s Lateral Motion State Space equations without any control signal (OPEN LOOP)
(3) Simulation for Longitudanal Dynamics of An Aircraft in State Space Form controlled using LQG controller
(4) Simulation for Lateral Dynamics of An Aircraft in State Space Form controlled using LQG controller
(5) Simulation for Longitudanal Dynamics of An Aircraft in State Space Form controlled using LQR controller
(6) Simulation for Lateral Dynamics of An Aircraft in State Space Form controlled using LQR controller
(7) Kalman Filtering for Aircraft’s Longitudanal Motion State Space Equations
There is one python file(.py file) that needs to be run respectively to get the simulation from it:
(1) Kalman Filtering for Aircraft’s Lateral Motion State Space Equations
